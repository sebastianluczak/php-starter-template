# Business Reqs

There's a system for placing some sort of **orders** for **products** by anonymous **clients**.

Each product is unique and is identified by some `name`.

Each product has random price at each point of time.

Each order can consist of many products.

Each product can be placed into order with any quantity.

Products have their stock.

If order is placed and stock is not available we should not create an order.

We want to know total price of each order.

Write a system for handling this type of orders.
